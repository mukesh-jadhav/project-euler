# project-euler
Euler's problems solved in python. Open to everybody.

The benefits of working on the Project Euler problems are too great to ignore:

<ul>
  <li>They’ll expose whether you understand the basic operations of the language you’re using, and they can be solved in any programming language</li>
  <li>You’ll learn how to write solid, standard, vanilla code. No libraries needed, so you won’t have crutches to rely on</li>
  <li>You’ll have to think about how you store and access data in memory</li>
  <li>You’ll need to optimize processing speed and think hard about algorithms</li>
</ul>

<b>
  With this in mind, Here's set of Euler's problems solved as per my knowledge. I won't consider the solutoins to be perfect that's why these are open to all. Feel free to modify and improve these. Let's make this a central place for all Euler problem solutions in python.</b>
